## What is TVLA
TVLA is an evolving research vehicle for abstract interpretation, featuring:
* A powerful language for expressing concrete semantics;
* Automatic generation of abstract interpreters from concrete semantics; and
* Tunable abstractions and tunable abstract transformers.

TVLA is naturally suited for checking properties of heap allocated data.
